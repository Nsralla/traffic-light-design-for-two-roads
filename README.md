# traffic-light-design-for-two-roads
The task is to design a solution to real problem which is the traffic light design for two roads. You will design a traffic light controller for the highway and farm road intersection shown in Figure 1. The traffic light controller outputs four 2-bit signals, highway Signal 1 and highway signal 2 and farm Signal 1 and 2, for the highway road and the farm road, respectively. The following encoding is used for both signals: 00 : Green 01 : Yellow (when changing from green) 10 : Red 11 : Red-Yellow (when changing from red) Description of the signals: Your design has 3 inputs which are: “Rst” : It returns the design to state 0, and counter to 0. “Go”: The default is that go = 1 in order to change between different states. However, if go is forced to 0 then the counter will stop counting (freeze). “clk” : Synchronous system. After building the design, you have to build a simple testbench which will implement a test for all cases (states).
